There are 2 projects, the 1st one is xml parsing.

To run project1, please make sure you install Anaconda for python 2.7. Anaconda would manage the libraries for you. Then navigate into the the folder, run in the command line: python project1

Then in project1/outputdata, there will be a json file with all the latitude and lentitide data.

For project2, the generated data would be saved in /project2/tmp.

To run project2, please make sure that the chromedriver matches your system. I am developing on windows. I have downloaded 2 versions of drivers in /project2/lib.  Go to the parent folder of project2, run : python project2. Then you will see the browser doing the scraping for you.
